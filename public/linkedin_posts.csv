Y,4mo,Ketan Joshi,Reflections on the Iberian Blackout: A Call for Data-Driven Analysis Over Blame,"The post reflects on the Iberian Blackout of April 28th, noting a lack of factual data, but detailing two initial generation trips and a 15GW loss of generation, leading to a cascaded blackout across Spain and Portugal. The author argues that grid balancing systems failed, and it's critical to understand the likelihood of recurrence and improve black start systems. It explicitly states that renewables were not the cause, highlighting that networks should withstand multiple generator losses and that low inertia in high renewable grids can be managed with modern infrastructure like batteries. The core message is that 'the blame game is a waste of time' and emphasizes the need for facts, data analysis, and data-driven conclusions to adjust behaviors and system designs.","Science, Policies and Measures, Impacts",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ketanjoshi1_there-is-still-so-little-factual-information-ugcPost-7323800643674996737-SNp8
Y,3mo,Frederic Hache,Debating Biodiversity Credits: Political Realism vs. Effective Conservation,"Frederic Hache recounts a discussion with an economist who supports biodiversity credits as the only politically realistic option, rejecting environmental legislation and redirecting harmful subsidies as 'maximalist demands'. The economist also opposed biodiversity offsetting but believed it was inevitable and should be improved, yet did not address Hache's points on the ineffectiveness and lack of environmental integrity of biodiversity markets and offsetting. Hache counters this view, arguing that radical change is necessary due to ecological crises, a majority of citizens are willing to change their lives for ecological crises, and historical achievements were once deemed 'politically unrealistic'. He suggests that support for biodiversity markets is politically motivated rather than fact-based.","Biodiversity, Economics, Policies and Measures, Impacts",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/frederic-hache-3b4120a_biodiversity-activity-7328071278454620161-45gV
Y,3mo,Lisa Sachs,Voluntary Carbon Markets: Conceptually Flawed and an Inefficient Distraction,"Lisa Sachs discusses Climate Farmers' decision to withdraw from carbon markets, agreeing that the voluntary carbon market (VCM) model is conceptually flawed. She argues that most carbon credits are purchased as offsets, creating a fiction that emissions in one place can be 'neutralized' by carbon-only removals elsewhere, ignoring localized harms and the true meaning of 'net zero'. Sachs highlights that many credits lack additionality or permanence, exaggerate impact, and divert financial and political capital from needed strategic financing frameworks. She concludes that VCMs are an inefficient, costly distraction, especially since countries often turn to them due to a failure in international community to mobilize proper financing for developing economies and ecosystem protection.","Carbon Accounting, Offsets, Economics, Policies and Measures, Impacts, Risk Disclosure",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lisa-sachs_carbonmarkets-activity-7332099747123519488-R28s/
Y,3mo,Linda Kalcher,EU's 2040 Climate Goal and International Cooperation for COP30,"Linda Kalcher highlights the importance of the EU agreeing on a 90% climate target for 2040 and a 2035 plan before mid-July to encourage China's NDC submission for the EU-China summit. She stresses international cooperation, especially given the US retreat from multilateralism, and calls for strong safeguards for Article 6 projects, with the EU setting a 'gold standard' for emissions reduction and project quality. The European Commission can assess and include specifics on Article 6 credits in its 2040 policy framework. However, a commenter, Delia Villagrasa, argues that the EU should achieve its reductions domestically without external credits, citing concerns about fraud, permanence, and questionable credits in voluntary markets, and noting the EU's scientific advisory body recommends domestic targets.","Policies and Measures, Carbon Accounting, Economics, Science",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/linda-kalcher-210867b0_climate-china-cop30-activity-7331315696158580737-d6lK/
Y,3mo,Ingmar Rentzhog,Climate Warning to Brazil: Oil Expansion Contradicts COP30 Promises,"Ingmar Rentzhog issues a 'Climate Warning' to Brazil, exposing its massive oil expansion plan, which directly contradicts scientific advice and COP30 promises. Brazil's administration approved offshore oil drilling near the Amazon River, potentially releasing 2.35 billion tons of CO?, and backed a bill weakening environmental impact assessments. These actions undermine Brazil's climate commitments despite President Lula's previous emotional plea at COP28. Rentzhog emphasizes that while development is a right, expanding oil drilling and dismantling science-based regulation are acts of 'destruction,' not 'development,' calling for leaders to listen to science.","Policies and Measures, Impacts, Business Impacts, Risk Disclosure",No matching URL found in provided list.
Y,3mo,Mari Luomi,Harmonized Standards for CO? Storage Critical for Carbon Market Trust,"Mari Luomi emphasizes that carbon markets require trust, and geological CO? storage necessitates harmonized standards, particularly as it becomes central to climate strategies like CCS, DACCS, and BECCS. She warns that weak or fragmented national regulations, especially in emerging economies, could lead to a 'race to the bottom' and undermine the environmental integrity and credibility of carbon markets under Article 6. International standards lack specificity and enforceability, and the finalized Article 6 rulebook alone won't achieve the necessary regulatory harmonization. Luomi and Wolfgang Heidug propose an international regulatory club to align standards, manage long-term risks, and boost investor confidence, unlock climate finance for emerging economies, and accelerate storage deployment.","Carbon Accounting, Carbon Capture, Policies and Measures, Economics, Risk Disclosure",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dr-mari-luomi_netzero-carbonmarkets-ccs-activity-7330536738936786944-gysf
Y,3mo,Will Alpine,AI's Electricity Demand Overstated and its Hidden Climate Impacts: Insights from Amory Lovins,"Will Alpine highlights Amory Lovins' paper, 'Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity,' which challenges the narrative of runaway AI energy demand and exposes blind spots in AI's climate, energy, and financial impacts. Key takeaways include the overstatement of AI's electricity demand, the financial risk of overbuilding, and the recommendation to pair data centers with scalable renewables like solar, rather than fossil fuels. The paper also warns that AI is accelerating fossil fuel extraction, with these 'enabled impacts' potentially outweighing any energy-saving benefits and repeating historical failures leading to unneeded power plants and soaring consumer costs.","Energy Transition, Impacts, Economics, Science, New Reports",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/willalpine_ai-energypolicy-climaterisk-activity-7330983047665709058-QC1M
Y,3mo,Charles Cozette,Reliability of Early Warning Signals for Climate Tipping Points Requires Rigorous Testing,"Charles Cozette discusses research indicating that statistical early warning signals for climate tipping points need rigorous testing to prevent false alarms. The ambiguity arises because identical statistical changes can occur in systems approaching irreversible tipping points and those undergoing smooth, reversible transitions. Additionally, data quality issues can create misleading trends in up to 30% of climate datasets. Scientists propose a Bayesian framework to integrate prior knowledge with detected signals, aiming to better quantify tipping probabilities and avoid overconfidence in ambiguous warnings.","Science, Risk Disclosure, Impacts",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlescozette01_ambiguity-of-early-warnings-signals-for-tipping-ugcPost-7324845287934418944-8KlW
Y,3mo,Tim Clairs,The Problem with 'Carbon Neutral' Claims: Shifting to Contribution Claims for Climate Action Integrity,"Tim Clairs discusses the growing skepticism and litigation surrounding 'carbon neutral' claims, exemplified by EnergyAustralia's settlement and Apple's ongoing claims. He argues that the issue lies not with carbon credits themselves, but with the 'compensation claim' inherent in 'carbon neutrality,' which assumes offsets exactly counterbalance ongoing emissions, despite widespread issues with methodologies, additionality, and permanence. Clairs proposes an alternative: 'contribution claims,' where companies communicate support for climate mitigation beyond their value chain without implying full offset. He suggests that government programs like Climate Active and companies like Apple should validate climate contributions instead of certifying carbon neutrality to enhance transparency and avoid greenwashing.","Carbon Accounting, Offsets, Litigation, Business Impacts, Policies and Measures, Risk Disclosure, Communications",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/copy-carbon-neutral-tim-clairs-dzzye/
Y,3mo,Zsolt Lengyel,Carbon Dioxide Removal: Beyond Private Cults to Public Accountability and Scalability,"Zsolt Lengyel argues that Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) cannot thrive as a private cult and demands transparency on energy consumption per ton and full life cycle impact assessment for engineered CDR. He asserts that the need for CO2 removal is directly linked to procrastination on mitigation, highlighting lessons from Climeworks' challenges. Lengyel questions whether CDR should be market-driven or managed as a public service, akin to sewage treatment, and calls for stakeholders' views on the regulatory environment needed to scale and speed up CDR before it's too late. He emphasizes that CDR should serve the public good, not merely venture capitalists.","Carbon Capture, Science, Economics, Policies and Measures, Risk Disclosure",No matching URL found in provided list.
Y,3mo ,Eric Matzner,Accelerating Earth's Energy Imbalance: A Call for Reframing Climate Action,"Eric Matzner highlights a climate paper revealing a significant acceleration in Earth's Energy Imbalance, which has nearly doubled in recent decades, indicating the planet is absorbing energy at an unprecedented rate. This acceleration, not fully accounted for in current climate models, is partly linked to the removal of sulfur from ship emissions, which previously provided unintentional solar radiation management. Matzner argues for reframing the climate conversation towards balancing Earth's energy intake, requiring GHG removal and potentially global cooling interventions (Solar Radiation Management) as a bridge to prevent irreversible tipping points like the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). He also warns of the risk of losing satellites that track this crucial data.","Science, Impacts, Policies and Measures, Risk Disclosure",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ericmatzner_any-time-you-see-a-climate-paper-with-this-activity-7328183885639421954-P3nR

Despite their value in advancing clean energy and climate tech across various sectors (Advanced Nuclear, Carbon Management, Clean Hydrogen, etc.), these 'smart reports with little political agenda' have been 'disappeared'. Thompson advocates for policymakers and industry leaders to revisit these crucial reports, noting that their disappearance is consistent with a 'systematic dismantling of governmental involvement in advancing science and technology'.","New Reports, Policies and Measures, Energy Transition, Science, Economics",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/janie-thompson-7b07597_pathways-to-commercial-liftoff-reports-activity-7330250238378586112-piIa
Y,4mo,Alexander Nevolin,Climate Risk and Asset Pricing: Uncovering Blind Spots in Market Models,"Alexander Nevolin explores whether climate risk is already priced into assets, challenging the efficient market theory by highlighting practical model limitations. He notes that while some pricing components (sectoral dividends, discount rates) may reflect climate uncertainty, others like volatility dynamics or jump processes are rarely calibrated for climate stress, and mean reversion speeds retain historical inertia. Nevolin suggests that model structure, data limitations, or path-dependent assumptions can create blind spots, leading to climate risk being underestimated or entirely absent in pricing, especially when GDP models ignore physical reality. He concludes that markets may be wrong in more places than thought, particularly regarding long-tail and unprecedented risks.","Risk Disclosure, Economics, Science, Business Impacts",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-nevolin-0ba0105_is-climate-risk-already-priced-in-there-activity-7324136699800805376-FH1B

Y,3mo,Jan Umsonst,New Data Confirms Significant Acceleration of Global Warming Since 2015,"Jan Umsonst discusses a new preprint that confirms the significant acceleration of global warming since 2015, driven by a synchronization of feedbacks from various Earth subsystems. This acceleration became notable during the 2015/16 El Niño, with contributions from high northern latitudes, Arctic amplification, other ocean areas, and subsurface heat release. The recent temperature jump saw an increase in contributing systems, such as Antarctic sea ice loss and marine heatwaves, leading to an expectation that future temperature jumps will further intensify these feedbacks and accelerate global warming. The Earth's Energy Imbalance is steadily increasing, driving every aspect of global warming and climate change.","Science, Impacts, Risk Disclosure, New Reports",No matching URL found in provided list.
Y,4mo,Assaad Razzouk,Positive Climate Developments: Global Energy Shift and Accelerating Legal Actions,"Assaad Razzouk compiles positive climate news, highlighting global energy shifts and legal actions, including election wins for pro-climate leaders, falling energy-related emissions per person, and significant increases in wind, solar, and nuclear capacity in China and Europe. He notes that solar panels will be mandatory for new homes in England, and Scotland's last oil refinery has ceased crude processing. Legal advancements include a paper quantifying climate damages by oil and gas companies for court evidence, Hawaii's lawsuit against Big Oil proceeding, and investors calling on HSBC to reinstate climate targets. However, a commenter, Andrew Gaines, cautions that renewable uptake isn't seriously displacing fossil fuels, with continued coal plant construction in China and industrialization in other regions, emphasizing the need for affluent nations to reduce industrial production and consumption.","Energy Transition, Policies and Measures, Litigation, Business Impacts, Impacts, Economics, Science, New Reports",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/assaadrazzouk_good-climate-news-this-week-1-albanese-wins-activity-7324795076440662016-1AYj

Non-fire related primary forest loss also increased by 14%, primarily due to conversion to agriculture, severely impacting Latin America. This widespread tree cover loss, including in boreal regions, is critical because tropical forests underpin livelihoods, carbon storage, water provision, and biodiversity, yet their services are often undervalued until lost. Addressing this requires simultaneous deployment of global, national, and subnational policies, financial incentives, and recognition of indigenous rights.","Biodiversity, Impacts, Policies and Measures, Economics, Science",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7331996515667808257/

She explains that projects outside a country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) can be eligible for a CA if emissions are nationally reported, while projects inside an unconditional NDC generally don't qualify. Projects in conditional NDCs can request CAs, but supply is limited and dependent on a country's agreement for various uses (NDC, CORSIA, Voluntary Use). Critics in the comments highlight that CAs are for double counting, not additionality or environmental integrity, and there's confusion about tradable budgets and the distinction between the VCM and Article 6 compliance markets.","Carbon Accounting, Policies and Measures, Economics, Risk Disclosure",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melissa-lindsay-46b0287_comment-demystifying-the-link-between-article-activity-7331533756052234241-hz2X
Y,4mo,Alexander Nevolin,Addressing the 'Piping Problem' in Climate Risk Models: Why Impacts Appear Muted,"Alexander Nevolin addresses why climate risk often appears 'not an issue' in models, attributing it to the 'piping' – how models are joined – rather than the models themselves. He illustrates this with the example of linking Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with Macro models, where a narrow connection using only a few parameters leads to climate impacts appearing muted in economic outcomes (inflation, growth). Crucially, there's often no feedback loop from the macroeconomy back to the IAM, creating a modeling artifact rather than reality. Nevolin urges scrutiny of these connections, as the field evolves towards more integrated models that seamlessly blend macroeconomic dynamics and technology diffusion.","Climate Risk, Economics, Science, Risk Disclosure",https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-nevolin-0ba0105_another-reason-climate-risk-seems-like-not-activity-7323657242648453120-_6A1
Y,3mo,Ketan Joshi,Major Review of Climate Accounting Standards: The Dangers of Blurring Emissions and Avoided Impact,"Ketan Joshi highlights a critical review of climate accounting standards, particularly the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG-P), warning against a push to blend measured emissions with 'avoided emissions' or 'measured action,' which risks rehashing the problems of carbon offsetting. He explains that 'market-based' accounting for electricity consumption, which allows companies to claim lower climate impact by financially supporting renewables, is problematic and often akin to the worst offsets, leading to under-reported emissions. Joshi argues that such blending weakens pressure on high-emitters, obscures transparency, and is being advocated by a coalition of tech companies, the 'Emissions First Partnership,' which could drastically reduce the costs and real impacts associated with emission reduction claims, ultimately distorting the true climate impact of rising power demand. He calls for improved accuracy and accountability in emissions measurement to ensure a clear picture of the problem.","Carbon Accounting, Offsets, Policies and Measures, Business Impacts, Risk Disclosure, Science",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-should-pay-attention-major-review-climate-accounting-joshi-tocgf/
